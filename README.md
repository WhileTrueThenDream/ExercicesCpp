Cpp Exercices
Exercises from book: C++ Crash Course by Lospinoso

Remarks: 
These are the solutions I implemented for the exercises of above described book but they might not be  optimal. 
It might also be that I missinterpreted the exercises and the code does something different than  what the author intended they did.
They might have a strong C accent because it is my preferred language. 
About the curly braces indent "{" and "}", I prefer that way because , (and this is "only" my opinion),  it makes code more readable, easy to change and scalate and less prone to errors, and because I like  it.

If you have found a better solution for the solved problems, or erros on what i programmed,I will thank you to notify me!
